This repository contains our material for the Term Project for the course of Analysis of Spatial Data and Images

Structure of the repository: 
- Data: could not been able to add the files because of their large size
    - train, test and validation images 
    - link to the data folder on Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1be9566TR8NHy8nJ2gc0RyvKhJnB5qsOV?usp=sharing
- Code:
    - functions: Functions that were used during the project. Classified into two groups: 
        - helper_functions.py: functions for mostly visualization purposes
        - preprocess_and_stats.py: functions to apply the different augmentation methods, to load the data and metrics to evaluate predictions   
    - notebooks: Contains three notebooks, one for each model. In the notebooks we build the three different models, train and them evaluate them.  
- Models: trained models
- Term paper
